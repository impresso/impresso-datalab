## Good to know before starting

We refer to "named entity recognition" as NER, which is a tool that recognises entities such as persons and locations from text. A "named entity linker" (NEL) connects these entities to an existing one such as a real person that can be found on Wikipedia (with a unique id in Wikidata). Wikipedia is a free, user-edited encyclopedia with articles on a wide range of topics like historical events, famous people, or scientific concepts. Wikidata is a sister project of Wikipedia that stores structured data, like facts and relationships between entities, used for tasks where computers need to understand and process data, such as NER and NEL.

{/* cell:1 cell_type:markdown */}
In the context of _Impresso_, the NER tool was trained on the [HIPE 2020](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data/blob/main/documentation/README-hipe2020.md) dataset. It was trained to recognise coarse and fine grained entities such as persons and locations, but also their names, titles, and functions. Further, the _Impresso_ NEL tool links these entity mentions to unique referents in a knowledge base – here Wikipedia and Wikidata – or not if the mention's referent is not found.

{/* cell:2 cell_type:markdown */}
You can also access our [NERC](https://huggingface.co/spaces/impresso-project/multilingual-named-entity-recognition) and [NEL](https://huggingface.co/spaces/impresso-project/multilingual-entity-linking) demo apps through [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces).

**Next, when running the code, if a question about a HuggingFace token appears, hit Cancel, we do not need it.**

{/* cell:3 cell_type:markdown */}

## Prerequisites

{/* cell:4 cell_type:markdown */}
First, we install some necessary libriaries and download the necessary files.

{/* cell:5 cell_type:code */}

```python
!pip install transformers
!pip install nltk
```

{/* cell:6 cell_type:markdown */}

## Entity Recognition

{/* cell:7 cell_type:code */}

```python
# Import necessary Python modules from the Transformers library
from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification, AutoTokenizer
from transformers import pipeline

# Define the model name to be used for token classification, we use the Impresso NER
# that can be found at "https://huggingface.co/impresso-project/ner-stacked-bert-multilingual"
MODEL_NAME = "impresso-project/ner-stacked-bert-multilingual"

# Load the tokenizer corresponding to the specified model name
ner_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
```

{/* cell:8 cell_type:markdown */}
Create a pipeline for named entity recognition (NER) using the loaded model and tokenizer.

{/* cell:9 cell_type:code */}

```python
ner_pipeline = pipeline("generic-ner", model=MODEL_NAME,
                        tokenizer=ner_tokenizer,
                        trust_remote_code=True,
                        device='cpu')
```

{/* cell:10 cell_type:code */}

```python
sentence = """In the year 1789, King Louis XVI, ruler of France, convened the Estates-General at the Palace of Versailles,
                where Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, alongside Maximilien Robespierre, a leading member of the National Assembly,
                debated with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the famous philosopher, and Charles de Talleyrand, the Bishop of Autun,
                regarding the future of the French monarchy. At the same time, across the Atlantic in Philadelphia,
                George Washington, the first President of the United States, and Thomas Jefferson, the nation's Secretary of State,
                were drafting policies for the newly established American government following the signing of the Constitution."""

print(sentence)
```

{/* cell:11 cell_type:code */}

```python
# Function to print each entry nicely
def print_nicely(data):
    for idx, entry in enumerate(data, start=1):
        for key, value in entry.items():
            print(f"  {key.capitalize()}: {value}")
        print()  # Blank line between entries

# Visualize stacked entities for each sentence
entities = ner_pipeline(sentence)

# Extract coarse and fine entities
print_nicely(entities)
```

{/* cell:12 cell_type:markdown */}

## Entity Linking

{/* cell:13 cell_type:markdown */}
Further, the _Impresso_ NEL tool links these the previously found entity mentions to unique referents in Wikipedia and Wikidata.

{/* cell:14 cell_type:code */}

```python
# Import the necessary modules from the transformers library
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

NEL_MODEL_NAME = "impresso-project/nel-mgenre-multilingual"

# Load the tokenizer and model from the specified pre-trained model name
# The model used here is "https://huggingface.co/impresso-project/nel-mgenre-multilingual"
nel_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("impresso-project/nel-mgenre-multilingual")
```

{/* cell:15 cell_type:code */}

```python
nel_pipeline = pipeline("generic-nel", model=NEL_MODEL_NAME,
                        tokenizer=nel_tokenizer,
                        trust_remote_code=True,
                        device='cpu')
```

{/* cell:16 cell_type:markdown */}
Our entity linker needs a specific format to be able to focus on the entity that we want to be linked, like in this example:

```
The event was held at the [START] Palace of Versailles [END], a symbol of French monarchy.
```

Assuming that the entity `Palace of Versailles` was previously detected by an NER tool, we need to surround it with `[START]` and `[END]`. Our tool only handles one entity per sentence/text, thus, for each entity in the same sentence, we need to create a different input, for example:

```
The event was held at the [START] Palace of Versailles [END], a symbol of French monarchy.
The event was held at the Palace of Versailles, a symbol of [START] French monarchy [END].

```

Let's take this example:

{/* cell:17 cell_type:code */}

```python
simple_sentence = "The event was held at the [START] Palace of Versailles [END], a symbol of French monarchy."

linked_entity = nel_pipeline(simple_sentence)

# Call the function
print_nicely(linked_entity)
```

{/* cell:18 cell_type:markdown */}
It _could_ work without the special markers and texts mentioning only one entity, but we do not recommend it.

{/* cell:19 cell_type:code */}

```python
simple_sentence = "The event was held at the Palace of Versailles, a symbol of French monarchy."

linked_entity = nel_pipeline(simple_sentence)

# Call the function
print_nicely(linked_entity)
```

{/* cell:20 cell_type:markdown */}
If we work with our NER tool, we can automatically create these sentences with entity markers and link each entity afterwards:

{/* cell:21 cell_type:code */}

```python
# Run the NER pipeline on the input sentence and store the results
entities = ner_pipeline(sentence)

print(f'{len(entities)} entities were detected.')

# List to keep track of already processed words to avoid duplicate tagging
already_done = []

# Process each entity for linking
for entity in entities:
    if entity['surface'] not in already_done:
        # Tag the entity in the text

        language = 'en'
        tokens = sentence.split(' ')
        start, end = (
            entity["index"][0],
            entity["index"][1],
        )

        context_start = max(0, start - 10)
        context_end = min(len(tokens), end + 11)

        nel_sentence = (
            " ".join(tokens[context_start:start])
            + " [START] "
            + entity['surface']
            + " [END] "
            + " ".join(tokens[end + 1 : context_end])
        )

        linked_entities = nel_pipeline(nel_sentence)
        print(nel_sentence)
        print_nicely(linked_entities)
```
