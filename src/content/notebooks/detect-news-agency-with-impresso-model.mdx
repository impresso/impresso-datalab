Delivering swift and reliable news since the 1830s and 1840s, news agencies have played a pivotal role both nationally and internationally. However, understanding their precise impact on shaping news content has remained somewhat elusive. Our goal is to illuminate this aspect by identifying news agencies within historical newspaper articles. Using data from newspapers in Switzerland and Luxembourg as part of the impresso project, we've trained our pipeline to recognize these entities.

If you're here, you likely seek to detect news agency entities in your own text. This notebook will guide you through the process of setting up a workflow to identify specific newspaper or agency mentions within your text.

{/* cell:1 cell_type:markdown */}
Install necessary libraries (if not already installed) and
download the necessary NLTK data.

{/* cell:2 cell_type:code */}
```python
!pip install transformers
!pip install spacy
!pip install pysbd
```

{/* cell:3 cell_type:markdown */}
Now the fun part, this function will download the requried model and gives you the keys to successfullly detect news agencies in your text.

{/* cell:4 cell_type:code */}
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Named Entity Recognition pipeline
newsagency_ner_pipeline = pipeline("newsagency-ner", model="impresso-project/ner-newsagency-bert-fr", trust_remote_code=True)
```

{/* cell:5 cell_type:markdown */}
Run the example below to see how it works.

{/* cell:6 cell_type:code */}
```python
# Example
text = """Apple est créée le 1er avril 1976 dans le garage de la maison
          d'enfance de Steve Jobs à Los Altos en Californie par Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak
          et Ronald Wayne, puis constituée sous forme de société le 3 janvier 1977 à l'origine
          sous le nom d'Apple Computer, mais pour ses 30 ans et pour refléter la diversification
          de ses produits, le mot « computer » est retiré le 9 janvier 2015. (Reuter)"""
