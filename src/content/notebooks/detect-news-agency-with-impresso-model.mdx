Delivering swift and reliable news since the 1830s and 1840s, news agencies have played a pivotal role both nationally and internationally. However, understanding their precise impact on shaping news content has remained somewhat elusive. Our goal is to illuminate this aspect by identifying news agencies within historical newspaper articles. Using data from newspapers in Switzerland and Luxembourg as part of the impresso project, we've trained our pipeline to recognize these entities.

If you're here, you likely seek to detect news agency entities in your own text. This notebook will guide you through the process of setting up a workflow to identify specific newspaper or agency mentions within your text.

_Note: This notebook requires `HF_TOKEN` to be set in the environment variables. You can get your token by signing up on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/join) and read more in the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.20.2/en/quick-start#environment-variable)_

Install necessary libraries (if not already installed) and
download the necessary NLTK data.

{/* cell:2 cell_type:code */}

```python
!pip install transformers
!pip install nltk
!pip install torch
```

{/* cell:3 cell_type:markdown */}
After having installed the necessary libraries (if not already installed) we download the necessary NLTK data to run our POS tagger: **averaged_perceptron_tagger**.
The averaged_perceptron_tagger is a efficient and effective part-of-speech (POS) tagger that basically tag each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. See [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02831](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02831) as reference.

{/* cell:4 cell_type:code */}

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

Now the fun part, this function will download the requried model and gives you the keys to successfullly detect news agencies in your text.

{/* cell:6 cell_type:code */}

```python
from transformers import is_torch_available
from transformers import pipeline

# Check if PyTorch is available
print(is_torch_available())

# Named Entity Recognition pipeline
nlp = pipeline("newsagency-ner", model="impresso-project/bert-newsagency-ner-fr", trust_remote_code=True)
```

{/* cell:7 cell_type:markdown */}
Run the example below to see how it works.

{/* cell:8 cell_type:code */}

```python
# Example
text = "Mon nom est François et j'habite à Paris. (Reuter)"
nlp(text)
```
