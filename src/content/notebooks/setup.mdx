{/* cell:0 cell_type:code */}
```python

impresso = connect()
```

## Search articles

In this notebook, we will search for articles that contain the term "European Union" in the text. The results are ordered by date.

Below the result container is rendered as an overview of what it contains.


{/* cell:2 cell_type:code */}
```python
result = impresso.search.find(
    q="European Union",
    order_by="date",
)
result
```

{/* cell:3 cell_type:markdown */}
Below, we will search for a term "European Union" in the Impresso data.
Then we will use the `result` variable, to access and print the excerpts of the first three articles returned by the search query.

The `pydantic` property is a [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) model representing the response of the Impresso API. It provides a way to ensure that the data conforms to specified types and constraints, making it easier to work with structured data in a reliable and consistent manner.
We use the `data` property of the response to iterate over the page of the results and return excerpts of the articles that contain the search term.

{/* cell:4 cell_type:code */}
```python
result = impresso.search.find(
    q="European Union",
    order_by="date",
)
for article in result.pydantic.data[:3]:
    print(article.excerpt)
```

{/* cell:5 cell_type:markdown */}
There are several useful properties on the result object that let us know the total nubmer of results found, the current page and its size.

{/* cell:6 cell_type:code */}
```python
print("%i results were found for this term. The current result object contains %i items starting from the item number %i" % (result.total, result.size, result.offset))
```

{/* cell:7 cell_type:markdown */}
### Pydantic
The full response from the Impresso API as a pydantic model.

{/* cell:8 cell_type:code */}
```python
result.pydantic
```

{/* cell:9 cell_type:markdown */}
### Pandas
We can also get the search results as a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame. 
This allows us to easily manipulate and analyze the data using pandas' powerful data manipulation capabilities.

{/* cell:10 cell_type:code */}
```python
df = result.df
df.head(2)
```

{/* cell:11 cell_type:markdown */}
## Get an article

Below we will use the `articles` resource to get an article by its ID:

{/* cell:12 cell_type:code */}
```python
article = impresso.articles.get("NZZ-1794-08-09-a-i0002")
article
```

{/* cell:13 cell_type:markdown */}
We can also get it as a Pydantic model or as a DataFrame.

{/* cell:14 cell_type:code */}
```python
article.pydantic.excerpt
```

{/* cell:15 cell_type:code */}
```python
article.df[['uid', 'country', 'language']]

```

{/* cell:16 cell_type:markdown */}
## Search facets

In this cell, we will search for facets related to the term "fromage" in the Impresso collection. This is a convenient way to see a breakdown of the search results by country.


{/* cell:17 cell_type:code */}
```python
country_facet = impresso.search.facet("country", q="fromage")
country_facet.df
```
