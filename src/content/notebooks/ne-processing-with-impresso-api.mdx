We refer to "named entity recognition" as NER, which is a tool that recognises entities such as persons and locations from text. A "named entity linker" (NEL) connects these entities to an existing one such as a real person that can be found on Wikipedia (with a unique id in Wikidata). Wikipedia is a free, user-edited encyclopedia with articles on a wide range of topics like historical events, famous people, or scientific concepts. Wikidata is a sister project of Wikipedia that stores structured data, like facts and relationships between entities, used for tasks where computers need to understand and process data, such as NER and NEL.


{/* cell:1 cell_type:markdown */}
In the context of Impresso, the NER tool was trained on the [HIPE 2020](https://github.com/hipe-eval/HIPE-2022-data/blob/main/documentation/README-hipe2020.md) dataset. It was trained to recognise coarse and fine grained entities such as persons and locations, but also their names, titles, and functions. Further, the _Impresso_ NEL tool links these entity mentions to unique referents in a knowledge base – here Wikipedia and Wikidata – or not if the mention's referent is not found.

### Impresso project

[Impresso - Media Monitoring of the Past](https://impresso-project.ch) is an
interdisciplinary research project that aims to develop and consolidate tools for
processing and exploring large collections of media archives across modalities, time,
languages and national borders. The first project (2017-2021) was funded by the Swiss
National Science Foundation under grant
No. [CRSII5_173719](http://p3.snf.ch/project-173719) and the second project (2023-2027)
by the SNSF under grant No. [CRSII5_213585](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/213585)
and the Luxembourg National Research Fund under grant No. 17498891.
