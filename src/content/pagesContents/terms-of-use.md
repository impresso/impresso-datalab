The Impresso Datalab is a platform for programmatic data access and annotation services and is developed by the [Impresso project](https://impresso-project.ch) which strives to create meaningful links across historical media collections. The Datalab enables custom analyses of the Impresso corpus and the semantic indexation of external document collections also with the help of models created by the project.

## 2. THE IMPRESSO PROJECT

Leveraging an unprecedented corpus of newspaper and radio archives, **Impresso – Media Monitoring of the Past** is an interdisciplinary research project that uses machine learning to pursue a paradigm shift in the processing, semantic enrichment, representation, exploration, and study of historical media across modalities, time, languages, and national borders.

The project develops natural language processing techniques to enrich media archives with semantic annotations and to advance digital history research and methods. Impresso designs, implements and provides access to a Graphical User Interface  and an Application Programming Interface for exploring, visualising and comparing large historical print and audio collections.

Impresso is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation under grant No. CRSII5_213585 and by the Luxembourg National Research Fund under grant No. 17498891.

## 3. DATA ACCESSIBLE VIA THE IMPRESSO INTERFACE AND API.

Three types of data are available through the Interface and API, namely **Media Archives**, **Collection Metadata** and **Semantic Enrichments**  (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Data”).

### 3.1 Media Archives.

Impresso receives Media Archive collections from partner cultural heritage institutions across Europe. Media Archive collections form the Impresso Corpus and correspond to:

- **Print Media Archives**, i.e., **digitised collections of newspapers, radio magazines and radio tapescripts**, composed of the following:

  - Facsimiles of periodical pages;

  - Transcripts, i.e. the output of Optical Character Recognition (OCR);

  - Images (i.e. illustrations, drawings, photographs) appearing on facsimiles alongside the text.

- **Audio Media Archives,** i.e. **digitised collections of radio broadcasts**, composed of the following:

  - Audio records of the program;

  - Transcripts, i.e. the output of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).

Moreover, we define a Content Item \*\*\*\*as the smallest text unit of editorial content in a newspaper or radio collection, i.e. an article in the case of newspapers, or a radio show or episode in the case of radio programs.

### 3.2 Metadata.

Metadata (hereinafter “Metadata”) corresponds to contextual information about the media archive collections and includes descriptive metadata (e.g. title, dates, place of publication), structural metadata (e.g. issue, page, content item identifiers), and administrative metadata (file timestamps, file creator, preservation information).

### 3.3. Semantic Enrichments.

Semantic Enrichments \*\*\*\*correspond to various types of structured information and computational representations of Media Archives extracted or computed from the Impresso Corpus by the Impresso Project. Semantic Enrichments include, for example, embeddings of words, sentences, entities and images, OCR quality assessment, n-gram statistics, named entity mentions and entities, Content Item classes, topics and topics assignments on Content Items, and text re-use clusters and passages.

It is specified that Media Archives, Metadata and Semantic Enrichments are subject to various copyrights and intellectual property rights held by Impresso Partners and Impresso Project, and that Users, in the course of their authorised access, accept responsibility for the appropriate handling and management of these Data in accordance with these ToU.

## 4. ACCESS TO DATA AND POSSIBLE ACTIONS THROUGH THE INTERFACE AND THE API

There are two types of Actions possible on the Data through the Interface and API:

- Explore: This includes searching, browsing, exploring, visualising, and comparing Media Archives, Metadata, and Semantic Enrichments.

- Get: This allows for the export of certain Media Archives, Metadata, and Semantic Enrichments.

Access to Data and the permitted Actions through the Interface and API depend on the copyright status of the Media Archives and on the User's status.

These ToU apply to all Users irrespective of their status, and to all Data irrespective of the method of retrieval (whether through Explore or Get actions).

## 5. CONDITIONS FOR OPENING AN IMPRESSO USER ACCOUNT

A User may register an Impresso User Account \*\*\*\*to access more Data and Services. This account is assigned individually and requires an email address and password for authentication.

To open an Impresso Account, a User must complete the online registration form by providing his/her first and last name(s), email address, academic affiliation if any, and a brief description of the intended research. Once the registration has been validated by the Impresso Project and/or the Cultural Heritage Institution and the User has accepted the ToU, a confirmation email will be sent inviting the User to activate his/her interface or API account. Once the account has been activated, the User will receive a password that will allow him/her to log into the GUI and/or request a time-limited API token.

The opening of an account by a User is free of charge. The User undertakes to provide accurate, complete and up-to-date personal information. It is strictly forbidden to create an account using a false identity, a pseudonym or in a fraudulent manner.

In the event that the User uses his/her account, login details or the Data and content accessible on the interface or via the API in violation of these ToU, he/she may be held liable under civil and/or criminal law.

The User's passwords and API tokens are personal and the User must not disclose them to any third party.

## 6. MEDIA ARCHIVE COPYRIGHTS DOMAINS

There are two Media Archive Copyright Domains:

1. **Public Domain**: Media Archive that are ineligible for copyright protection or whose copyright has expired and is therefore freely available for anyone to use without restriction.

2. **Protected Domain**: Media Archive that are under copyright \*\*\*\*but are accessible and usable for personal use or for research purposes or for educational purposes.

Access to Media Archive within the Protected Domain may be conditioned according to academic affiliation and partner cultural heritage institution, as explained on this information page: LINK.
