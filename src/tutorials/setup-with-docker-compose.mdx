In our user scenario, we want to run jupterlab in our browser without messing with the installation of
jupyterlab and its dependencies. DOcker is one tool that could help us achieve this.
This is largely based on https://docs.docker.com/guides/use-case/jupyter/

## What is Docker compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running different applications, called `services`.
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
Basically you need docker installed and a terminal to run the commands.
First things first, let's get ther right docker-compose from the official website.

## Let's run JupyterLab!

There is a handy docker compose file based on the official docker documentation. Have a ook at this: https://docs.docker.com/guides/use-case/jupyter/#create-a-compose-file
Save this file in a folder called `my-folder` (or pick a better name) and name it `docker-compose.yml`. This is the content of the file:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  jupyter:
    image: quay.io/jupyter/scipy-notebook:python-3.11
    ports:
      - 8888:8888
    environment:
      - NOTEBOOK_TOKEN=${NOTEBOOK_TOKEN:-"mytoken"}
    command: jupyter lab --NotebookApp.token=${NOTEBOOK_TOKEN}
    volumes:
      - ./notebooks:/home/jovyan/work:rw
```

Create an empty folder `notebooks` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.
This is where your notebooks will be stored and this is the path in the `volumes`section of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

finally, this is now your folder structure:

```bash
my-folder/
├─ notebooks/
└─ docker-compose.yml
```

As soon as you have docker installed and running ;), you can run the following command to start a jupyterlab server:

```bash
docker compose up
```

and tah-dah! localhost:8888 should open in your browser and you can start working on your notebooks.

## Yes, but where are my python packages...?

If you need to install specific python packages,things will get a bit more complicated and you need to have your own doc

```Dockerfile
FROM quay.io/jupyter/base-notebook
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir matplotlib scikit-learn
```

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  jupyter:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 8888:8888
   environment:
      - NOTEBOOK_TOKEN=${NOTEBOOK_TOKEN:-"mytoken"}
    command: jupyter lab --NotebookApp.token=${NOTEBOOK_TOKEN}
    volumes:
      - ./notebooks:/home/jovyan/work:rw
```
