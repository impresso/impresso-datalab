# From impresso app to impresso dataalb
[impresso app](https://impresso.github.io/impresso-app/) is a web application that allows users to search and browse the impresso dataset.
It is a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for articles, newspapers, and entities.
It has beren used in teaching course in history course and has been used in many student projects.
By giving researchers access to tools and resources, impresso app empowered them to explore new ideas and reversely it grew in complexity and feature to accomodate user needs and wishes.

However, as the application evolved, it became apparent that certain limitations needed addressing, basically the impresso UI was simply not enough. 

In terms of data analysis, users found it challenging to compare findings within impresso with other datasets. Similarly, the 
lack of options for creating custom visualizations hindered effective data visualization.

The impresso app was also limited in terms of reproducibility, as it was difficult to share and reproduce analysis with other researchers. This was a significant barrier to collaboration and knowledge sharing within the impresso community.

At the same time, advancements in tools and libraries were occurring, particularly in the realm of text corpus analysis. Jupyter notebooks emerged as a popular platform for documenting libraries, testing code, and sharing findings in a narrative format, becoming more and more popular. A vibrant community formed around data visualization and analysis within Jupyter Notebooks, with many scientific journals now accepting them as submission formats to enhance reproducibility.


Moreover, as artificial intelligence (AI) gained prominence, Jupyter Notebook became indispensable for experimenting with algorithms and visualizing data. Supported by platforms like MyBinder, Github CodeSpace, and Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks provided an interactive environment ideal for learning and implementing AI programming.

Building upon this principle, we made the decision to launch a new platform: the impresso datalab. This innovative platform consists of several key components:

- A secure API: We aim at developing a secure API that enables users to access the impresso dataset outside of the impresso app. This API is carefully monitored and restricted to prevent exploitation and unauthorized access, ensuring the integrity and security of the data.
- A documentation website, not only provides access to example notebooks but also links them with the API documentation. 

- A list of models are open source on HuggingFace

- A series of Jupyter Notebooks: We aim at providing a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to access and analyze the impresso dataset. These notebooks are designed to be user-friendly and accessible to researchers of all levels, from beginners to experts. They are also designed to be easily shared and reproduced, enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing within the impresso community.

- Python library: Additionally, we aim at creating a dedicated Python library aimed at simplifying the development of custom Python scripts and to be easily integrated in notebooks. This library is designed to streamline workflows and empower users to leverage the impresso dataset effectively.

- A console for the researchers, for authentication tokens, thus enhancing user experience by streamlining access and management.

- a console for data providers: This console allows data providers to monitor and manage user requests of their data in impresso.
